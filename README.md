# Open Production-ready Web Projects [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of real world web projects that are:

- In use in production
- The source is available as Open source
- Can be deployed locally/on-prem
- Ready to use (zero development required)
- Preferrably offered as SaaS service as well

The projects are grouped by the language and framework they're built upon. This list is intended to show how a particular framework is used and designed in real world application, not just in hobby/learning project. The developers should be able to learn how professional developers write a large codebase, how deployment looks like on PaaS/VM, how to work in a large team, and eventually contribute to them. 

Feel free to add more project repositories here by sending a [Pull Request](https://github.com/sdil/open-production-web-projects).

This project is inspired by [free-for.dev](https://free-for.dev).
